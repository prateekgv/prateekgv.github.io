### About Me
I am Data Scientist at [__Calico Life Sciences__](https://www.calicolabs.com/). Here, I work cross-functionally with other individual contributors within computing group, as well as researchers, on collaborative research projects, which may be centered around biological questions, analytical methods, or engineering.

Prior to joining Calico, I graduated with a Ph.D. degree (2019) in [__Electrical Engineering__](http://ese.wustl.edu/) from [__Washington University in St. Louis__](http://wustl.edu). I worked at the Integrated Signal Processing In Research and Education ([__INSPIRE__](https://www.ese.wustl.edu/~nehorai/lab.html)) lab under the advising of Prof. [__Arye Nehorai__](https://www.ese.wustl.edu/~nehorai/index.html). Before joining graduate school, I worked as a project associate in Prof. [__K.V.S. Hari's__](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~hari/) lab at the [__Indian Institute of Science__](https://www.iisc.ac.in/).
